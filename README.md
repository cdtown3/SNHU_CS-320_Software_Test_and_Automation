# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Testing the code is best way to ensure functionality and security. In these projects I created JUnit 5 tests to perform automated unit tests on my code. I implemented the user requirements checks into the object setters. I then had to check that these requirements returned errors if they weren't met. This is where my unit testing helped. Other than unit tests, developers and testers can perform integration, system, and acceptance testing to ensure secuirty and functionality.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Gathering the users' needs by asking the right questions is very important. 

# How do I approach designing software?
