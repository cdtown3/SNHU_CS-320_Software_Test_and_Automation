# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Testing the code is best way to ensure functionality and security. In these projects I created JUnit 5 tests to perform automated unit tests on my code. I implemented the user requirements checks into the object setters. I then had to check that these requirements returned errors if they weren't met. This is where my unit testing helped. Other than unit tests, developers and testers can perform integration, system, and acceptance testing to ensure secuirty and functionality.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Gathering the users' needs by asking the right questions is very important. Once the developer understands what these needs are, they are implemented via input validation. Input validation can be used to set variable limits, like length. After incorporating user requirements into input validation, unit tests should be used to ensure the validation is working.

# How do I approach designing software?
I approach software development with security and user requirements at the front of my mind. I'll run static and dynamic tests to ensure the application is working as expected and meets requirements. I'll then run vulnerability checks using tools, like Maven's Dependency Check, to ensure any dependencies are up-to-date and I can patch any security holes.
